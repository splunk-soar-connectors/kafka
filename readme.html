    <h2>Kerberos Authentication</h2>
    If you wish to authenticate with the Kafka instance using Kerberos, the following items are needed:
    <ul>
        <li>A Kerberos Principal will be needed for "<b>phantom</b>"</li>
        <li>Normal Kerberos requirements (KDC, Keytabs, Principals, etc) still apply</li>
        <li><b>kinit</b> must be run for the <b>phantom</b> principal, for the <b>phantom-worker</b> user</li>
        <li>It should be noted that Kerberos tickets will expire, so it is recommended to use a script to run <b>kinit</b> periodically to refresh the ticket for <b>phantom-worker</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SSL Authentication</h2>
    To authenticate with the Kafka instance using SSL, the following configuration parameters may be required. They are to be pointed to the location of certain files:
    <ul>
        <li><b>cert_file</b> - A signed certificate file that is trusted by the Kafka instance</li>
        <li><b>key_file</b> - The key used to generate <b>cert_file</b></li>
        <li><b>ca_cert</b> - The certificate of the certificate authority that signed <b>cert_file</b></li>
    </ul>
    It is recommended that these files be placed under the <b>/opt/phantom/etc/ssl/</b> directory. These files must be readable by the <b>phantom-worker</b> user.<br><br>Note that not all of these files will be necessary for all setups. More than likely, <b>cert_file</b> will be required. However the other parameters will be needed in certain cases. For example, <b>ca_cert</b> will be needed if you set up your own certificate authoritiy.
