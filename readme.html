    <h2>Kerberos Authentication</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A Kerberos Principal will be needed for "<b>phantom</b>"</li>
        <li>Normal Kerberos requirements (KDC, Keytabs, Principals, etc) still apply</li>
        <li><b>kinit</b> must be run for the <b>phantom</b> principal, for the <b>phantom-worker</b> user</li>
        <li>It should be noted that Kerberos tickets will expire, so it is recommended to use a script to run <b>kinit</b> periodically to refresh the ticket for <b>phantom-worker</b></li>
    </ul>
